						<p>"Why didn’t I learn about money when I was in school?" We've all asked that question. Beginning with the financial crisis of 2008, lawmakers and educators began taking financial literacy – ands its deep personal and societal consequences – seriously.</p>
						<p>We’re now at a turning point: states and schools have adopted Standards of Learning for personal finance. Their main setback, however, is funding.</p>

						<h3>Be there, for these students, at just the right moment in their lives.

						<p>Our sponsors have found that by teaching financial literacy they are building lasting relationships with teachers, schools, and students. These relationships result in increased membership and business in their local communities. Nothing matters more to local families than their children. By taking care of their youth you can build an entirely new level of involvement with the community and its future leaders.</p>
